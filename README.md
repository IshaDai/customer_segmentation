# **customer_segmentation**

## **Abstract** 
Machine Learning (ML) has gradually become a joint election in 
customer segmentation and can solve problems faster and better than 
conventional techniques. Our study focuses on making identifiable, 
sustainable, and practical segmentation in the market. We first identified 
customer groups with unsupervised learning methods and then checked 
the cluster sustainability with supervised learning algorithms. In 
conclusion, customers of online retail stores are successfully segmented, 
which demonstrated clear patterns of shopping preference. In the future,
our findings would be potential in developing up-selling and crossselling strategies.

### **Introduction** 
Market segmentation divides a broad business market into sub-groups of homogeneous 
consumers with shared characteristics [1]. It aims to identify high-yield segments that are 
likely to be the most profitable or have growth potential [2]. Functional segments should 
demonstrate measurability, accessibility, sustainability, and actionability [3]. This project 
practices market segmentation using machine learning with online retail data. It explores 
the purchasing behaviors of different segments in the segmentation, targeting, and 
positioning (STP) approach and builds a predictive model of customer shopping 
preferences. Specifically, unsupervised algorithms, like K-means and agglomerative 
methods, are leveraged to identify the segments, and a series of supervised models are 
added to check the sustainability of the clusters. Besides this, an empirical model (RFM 
model) is used for feature engineering. This project is hoped to help companies better 
understand their customers’ needs, and precise marketing programs can be developed to 
boost revenue and enhance market competitiveness.

### **Conclusion** 
This project first identified customer groups with unsupervised learning methods and then 
checked the cluster sustainability with supervised learning algorithms. In this process, 
customers of online retail stores are successfully segmented with different purchasing 
powers, measured by recency, frequency, and monetary value. Clear patterns of shopping 
preference are detected among distinct segments. These findings would be helpful in
developing up-selling and cross-selling strategies. Limitations exist due to a lack of 
specific business scenarios. It could be extended and polished by incorporating specific 
marketing purposes and building pipelines to evaluate profit generation.


### **Limitations and Improvements** 
• **Prediction Model Accuracy:** The construction of the prediction model is based on the 
accuracy of the K-means Clustering Model 

• **Model Robust Test:** From the results comparisons, even though the KNN model performs 
better than others, it does not mean it is always the best model. Hence, a robust test of 
the KNN model is necessary

• **Future Improvements:** Prediction label ‘cluster’ is imbalanced à oversampling methods
